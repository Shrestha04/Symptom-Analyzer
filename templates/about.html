        <div class="block">
          <p>
            At <span class="highlight">Symptom Analyzer</span>, we believe
            everyone deserves peace of mind about their health. With life's fast
            pace and overwhelming information online, it's easy to feel lost
            when symptoms arise.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's why we built Symptom Analyzer — a supportive, AI-driven
            platform designed to interpret your symptoms and suggest meaningful
            next steps.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Why We Do This</h3>
        <div class="block">
          <p>
            Health issues can create confusion and fear. We know that having
            symptoms without answers is stressful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our goal is to offer you a first step toward clarity — helping you
            understand potential causes and actions, with compassion and
            convenience.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <div class="block">
          <p>
            We’re on a mission to make health analysis quick, accessible, and
            meaningful. Whether it’s a common cold or something more complex,
            you shouldn’t have to wait or worry endlessly. Symptom Analyzer
            empowers you to act smarter, sooner.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Health Chatbot</h3>
        <div class="block">
          <p>
            In addition to physical health, we understand the importance of
            mental well-being. That’s why we’ve integrated a
            <span class="highlight">Health Advisor</span> — your AI companion
            designed to provide emotional support, encouragement, and
            stress-relieving conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            While it's not a replacement for professional therapy, it’s a safe
            and friendly space where you can talk, reflect, and feel heard —
            24/7. We believe mental health matters just as much as physical
            health.
